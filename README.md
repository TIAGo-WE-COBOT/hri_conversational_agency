# Conversational agents in ROS

This package is a container for ROS modules, developed for easy integration of conversational agents in ROS.

## Installation

* Clone the repo with
    ```
    git clone ...
    ```
* Install the common requirements with
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
> [!NOTE]
> The above command will not install the requirements for any specific backend (as OpenAI-GPT or Meta LLama). As such, you will only be able to run a pre-scripted bot as in []

## Setup

<!--### OpenAI

- Get your API key from [this link](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and copy it to your clipboard.
- Create a file named `.env` in the package root, if you do not already have one.
- Open the `.env` file and add the following line
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
    ```
    where `<your_api_key>` has to be susbstituted with the actual API key obtained at the first step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the `.gitignore` file includes a `.env` or `*.env` entry to avoid the file with the API key being tracked by Git. -->
